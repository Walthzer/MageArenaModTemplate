This folder should contain the .DLL files you mod references (the assembly references).

To reference .DLL files used by the MageArena game, copy them from the game files.
You can find these in: <Steam>\Mage Arena\MageArena_Data\Managed\
Don't include .DLL files that you don't need.

If you are referencing a modded API, e.g. BlackFishAPI you should include its DLL file here. (Get it from the mods files)
